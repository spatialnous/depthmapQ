# depthmapQ Documentation

depthmapQ is a tool for spatial analysis, originally written as a research
project by Alasdair Turner (targeting the Windows platform only), then later
ported to Qt and made available cross platform by Tasos Varoudis, and is now
under active development by a small team of members of Bartlett School of 
Architecture at UCL and volunteers.
