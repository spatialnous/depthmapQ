## depthmapQ - multi-platform spatial network analyses software

This is a fork of [Depthmap](https://github.com/SpaceGroupUCL/Depthmap) and [depthmapX](https://github.com/SpaceGroupUCL/depthmapX) that keeps up with the, originally internal - now external, spatial analysis library [salalib](https://github.com/spatialnous/salalib).
As such, this software is now purely a Graphical User Interface to the analysis library and is only updated to make sure it runs.
The interface code has collected a lot of technical debt over the years and thus there are currently no plans to develop this further.
If you would like me to fix/develop this further, feel free to contribute with code or consider [sponsoring my work](https://github.com/sponsors/pklampros)!

Latest releases can be found at the [releases page](https://github.com/spatialnous/depthmapQ/releases)
Current development snapshots can be found under the [Actions page](https://github.com/spatialnous/depthmapQ/actions), by choosing the latest action for the appropriate platform and finding the artifacts at the bottom of the result.

For any issues/bugs/crashes please create [a new issue](https://github.com/spatialnous/depthmapQ/issues/new)
